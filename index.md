### Automation (OT / IT)
- **Plant Information System**: Full-Stack Programming of Various web-based reports - Connected to the Allen-Bradley PLC, the Aveva (Wonderware) Intouch SCADA downloads data to the Microsoft Access database. Utilizing HTML, Javascript and ASP the page is published on the plant intranet and can be viewed by the supervisors. This is a cost-effective project since using the proprietary report system requires expensive licenses. ðŸ“· [Plant Reports](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t4a3GVH8YI3ot_EorpwQ1Pfvgt6tiZSK/view?usp=drive_link)
- **Industrial Control Systems**: Relay ladder logic programming, SCADA scripting and SQL configuration - The Systems were commissioned using Allen-Bradley PLC5/80C, SLC5/04, ControlLogix , Aveva Intouch HMI and InSQL Realtime Historian. These are control systems for a manufacturing facility. ðŸ“· [SCADA / Ladder Logic Programs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cv0vzFkQk5QDdNg126vAUqGn0hX8cgOd/view?usp=drive_link)
- **SCADA Server Migration**: Virtualization and server configuration - At that time the manufacturing plant's budget for an upgrade for the SCADA hardware and software was limited, the problem is the servers hardware is already showing first sign of failure. The solution is to virtualize the two servers to manage the cost of upgrade. Utilizing the office server and VMWare software the project was successfully commissioned.ðŸ“· [Network Configuration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rykSjoap0XviWooxovC808FpPcJUtlxX/view?usp=drive_link)
- **Short Message Service (SMS) Application**: Visual basic programming, AT commands, SQL queries and Microsoft Access database configuration - Equipment downtime was extended due to the maintenance team's slow response. The maintenance team responded slowly to the issue as a result of the delayed communication from the plant personnel. The solution is to develop a warning and alarm system to convey immediately the problem to the team.ðŸ“„  [Application Configuration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M-KEab04j6d_dI3mGJ_ZyBoYDgOuD3iA/view?usp=drive_link)
